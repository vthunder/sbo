# Simple Blockchain Objects (SBO)

**Version: v0.4 (Draft)**

Simple Blockchain Objects (SBO) define a minimal, flexible, and human-readable system for posting, updating, and managing structured data on-chain. SBOs provide composable building blocks for decentralized data, identity, and governance ‚Äî without requiring smart contracts.

---

## üß± Core Concepts

- **Objects & Collections** ‚Äî Hierarchical data model similar to a filesystem
- **Signed Envelopes** ‚Äî Canonical serialization, content hashing, and signatures
- **Policy Enforcement** ‚Äî Path-scoped governance with programmable rules
- **Name Resolution** ‚Äî Human-readable identities and cross-chain bindings
- **URIs** ‚Äî Durable, linkable, versioned references to SBO objects, even cross-chain

## üß© Example Use Cases

- **NFTs** with programmable minting and transfer policies
- **Cross-chain objects** that are versioned and verifiable
- **Decentralized identities** tied to human-readable names
- **Application-layer state** anchored to data availability layers
- **Governed namespaces** where paths are managed by identity or DAO

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Extensibility Roadmap

- Bridging to other blockchains (as ERC-721)
- Verifiable off-chain computation (ZK policy conditions)
- Signed collections, indexes, snapshots
- WASM-based and declarative policies
- Merge strategies (CRDTs, diffs, etc.)
- Support for content-addressed payloads (IPFS, Arweave)

---

## üß™ Status

This is a **draft specification**, under active development. Expect changes as the model is refined and tested with SDK implementations and real-world use cases.
